Overview

This Python script demonstrates the use of fundamental data types and structures in Python while simulating a hotel booking summary.
It walks through integers, strings, booleans, lists, arrays, and dictionaries with real-world examples.

Features

Integers

Calculates total, average, minimum, and maximum bookings.

Strings

Creates a formatted booking report using f-strings.

Booleans

Uses a threshold condition to determine booking status.

Lists

Demonstrates adding, removing, and sorting booking days.

Arrays

Shows how to use the array module to handle numeric data.

Compares array sum with list sum.

Dictionaries

Manages hotel room records.

Updates and deletes dictionary entries.

Computes total value across records.

Code Structure
import array

# Integers section (total, average, min, max)
# Strings section (summary report)
# Booleans section (threshold check)
# Lists section (append, remove, sort)
# Arrays section (sum and comparison)
# Dictionaries section (update, delete, compute total)

How to Run

Ensure Python 3.13+ is installed on your system.

Save the script as hotel_booking.py.

Run the script in your terminal:

python hotel_booking.py

Example Output
=== Integers Section ===
Total bookings: 148
Average bookings: 29.60
Min bookings: 18
Max bookings: 40

=== Strings Section ===
Hotel Booking Summary Report
Total bookings recorded: 148
Average bookings per day: 29.60

=== Booleans Section ===
Status: Above Standard

=== Lists Section ===
Before modifications: ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri']
After modifications: ['Fri', 'Mon', 'Sat', 'Thu', 'Tue']

=== Arrays Section ===
Array sum: 73
List sum: 148
Array sum is smaller than List sum

=== Dictionaries Section ===
Final Records: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Deluxe Room', 'value': 120}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'Suite Room', 'value': 220}]
Total value across records: 340
